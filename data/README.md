This directory contains datasets for the Neural Network with PSO project.

## Example Datasets

Place datasets here for use with the model. Supported formats:

- CSV files with features and labels
- Sample datasets for classification and regression problems

## Data Format

For CSV files, each row should represent a sample, with the last column containing the target value (label for classification, value for regression). Headers are optional and can be specified in the command-line arguments.

Example:
```
feature1,feature2,feature3,label
1.2,2.3,3.4,0
2.3,3.4,4.5,1
